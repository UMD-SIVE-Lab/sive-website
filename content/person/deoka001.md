*Title:* Real-Time Snow Rendering

*Year:* 2009

### Abstract

In snowing conditions, following a snowplow can be extremely
perilous. The conditions obstruct the human's visual system's ability
to accurately perceive speed and motion of the snowplow, resulting in
the potential for rear end collisions. The goal of my research is to
create a real time virtual environment of snowing conditions. This
virtual environment will provide much improved visual rendering of
snow that takes into account the physical interaction between the snow
particles and the light entering the snow cloud. Improving the quality
of snow rendering in interactive environments has the potential to
make driving simulators more effective at understanding how people
drive in a variety of conditions.
