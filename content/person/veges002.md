Aditya worked on the optimization system used in this GEnUSiS
Project. He focused on developing a language that facilitates running
optimization using of any of the variables within the QUIC EnvSim
system as parameters. He also performed the investigative tests and
analysis of the optimization system using  the NSF-funded BOINC system
for accessing grid/volunteer computing.
