[Jonathan Beaulieu](http://www.d.umn.edu/~beau0307) is an undergraduate working in the lab on virtual reality environments.

Jonathan has focused on working with the Unreal Engine to create an accurate simulation of a section of Mars. He created a plugin for Unreal to import terrain data from NASA's DEM format. This plugin imports both the height data and textures. He has also been working on integrating the Smart Shoe into Unreal to provide better haptic feedback.
