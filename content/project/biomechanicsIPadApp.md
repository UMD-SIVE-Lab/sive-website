Project Overview
================
The discipline of biomechanics focuses on the study of human motion and in particular, analyzing human motion to help make performance improvements in people's actions.  Biomechanics relies on precisely measuring the location of points on a subjectâ€™s body throughout the course of completing a motion.  The conclusions drawn from the analysis of this data can be used to improve the way any motion is carried out.  For instance a tennis player that wants to maximize the velocity of his serve could employ biomechanic analysis  to determine the sequence of motions that optimizes the force he can exert on the ball.  This UROP proposes to develop a biomechanics iPad application that will be used to teach biomechanic analysis at the University of Minnesota Duluth.  The application that we are working to develop will allow a researcher to collect the data necessary for motion analysis and later display it in graphical form.  The tool will feature a set of graphical data representations so that the collected data can be conveyed in a convenient way for a variety of tasks.
