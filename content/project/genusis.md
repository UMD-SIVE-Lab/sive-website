Project Overview
================

Over the past three decades, urban planners have attempted to make
cities more sustainable by espousing higher density urban design
concepts such as Compact Cities, Walkable Communities, and New
Urbanist developments. It has been argued by some urban planners that
the per capita energy use and air pollution emissions in densely built
cities are less than in their more sprawling less dense
counterparts. Green infrastructure projects, in the form of parks,
alteration of building rooftops, and the use of novel asphalt and
concrete materials for streets and parking lots, have also been
introduced to help reduce energy usage, mitigate pollution emissions,
and improving the urban microclimate. Unfortunately, the complex
effects of these interactions is not well understood on large urban
scales.

Our interdiscplinary efforts aim at increasing knowledge for how the
natural environment and urban form interact. Our hypothesis is that
urban structures and well placed green infrastructure exist which can
minimize energy use, while also minimizing air pollution exposure. We
have been investigating the complex interactions between urban form,
green infrastructure, and the environment across a variety of scales
to better understand these relationships. The results from our efforts
are designed to guide future urban projects, development, and policy.

Large-scale science simulation can assist in the optimization of urban
form, green infrastructure, and energy conservation by exploring large
problem domains. Our chief tool in performing these optimizations is
an extremely fast and inexpensive energy use and dispersion modeling
system that runs on the GPU. We utilize a suite of computationally
based strategies to bridge different scales of the urban environment
to improve our understanding for how green infrastructure interacts
with the urban environment at local (neighborhood), city, and
meso-scales (regional). Our GPU-based simulation codes are used within
a genetic algorithm optimization structure to explore large problem
domains narrowing down on sets of choices that satisfy many of our
constraints and goals for energy use and pollution mitigation. We will
also utilize an interactive and immersive virtual environment to
provide unprecedented understanding and refinement of the complex
physical processes associated with the energy balance and pollutant
dispersion in an urban setting.
