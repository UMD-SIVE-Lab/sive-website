Project Overview
================

### Real-time Environmental Simulation

Human populations are increasingly concentrated in urban regions,
which, in turn, are becoming major centers of pollution and energy
use. Our research aims to give urban planners tools to evaluate the
impact of building location and form on pollution dispersal and energy
needs.

> Our research utilizes GPUs to accelerate dispersion simulation and heat energy transfer to solve problems related to minimizing pollution and energy usage in urban environments.

While prior research enabled single simulations that could predict the impact of a particular design on pollution concentrations, by harnessing the multi-core power of computer graphics hardware (i.e. Graphics Processing Units or GPUs) to quickly run many thousands of simulations, this research is building tools that can suggest best-case designs to urban planners, potentially enabling cities that trap less pollution and require less energy to heat and cool.

We also utilize interactive and immersive virtual environment technology to provide unprecedented understanding and refinement of the complex physical processes associated with the energy balance and pollutant dispersion in an urban setting. We expect that the modeling capabilities that will be developed through this work will aid urban planners in developing useful and novel planning strategies to improve the sustainability of modern cities. Through this tool, we are addressing the following questions aimed at evaluating our hypothesis:

1. Can urban form be optimized to minimize air pollution while simultaneously minimizing building energy use?
2. Can interactive, immersive visualization and simulation assist engineers, urban planners, and students in understanding and refining complex environmental processes in the urban setting?
