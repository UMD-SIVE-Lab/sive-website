focuses on the experience of teaching undergraduate computer science
students to teach programming, using Scratch, to middle school
students. 

This is definitely an interesting approach to help bridge the issues
involved with teaching programming throughout the K-12 range. Computer
science students benefit by learning how to communicate their problem
solving skills. Moreover, the schools benefit by getting access to
people with expertise in programming.
